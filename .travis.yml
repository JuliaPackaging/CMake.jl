  # Every 30 seconds, look for the build log file. If it exists, then
  # start watching its contents and printing them to stdout as they
  # change. This has two effects:
  #   1. it avoids Travis timing out because the build outputs nothing
  #   2. it makes it more obvious what part of the build, if any, gets stuck
